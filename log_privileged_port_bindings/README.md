# log_privileged_port_bindings.py

A Python script that monitors and logs processes attempting to bind to privileged ports (ports < 1024). This tool is valuable for security auditing and tracking potential unauthorized network activity.

## Features

- **Privileged Port Monitoring**: Detects processes binding to ports below 1024.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on Linux, Windows, and macOS.
- **Detailed Logging**: Logs process details (PID, name, local and remote addresses, and status) with timestamps.

## How It Works

1. The script uses the `psutil` library to monitor active network connections.
2. It checks if any local address involves a privileged port (port < 1024).
3. For each match, the associated process details are logged to a file and optionally printed to the console.

## Requirements

- **Python**: Version 3.6 or newer
- **Dependencies**:
  - `psutil` library (install via `pip install psutil`)

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install psutil
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python log_privileged_port_bindings.py
   ```

3. Check the log file for privileged port binding attempts:
   ```bash
   cat privileged_port_bindings_log.txt
   ```

## Configuration

- **Log File**: Logs are saved to `privileged_port_bindings_log.txt` by default. Update the `log_file` variable in the script to use a different file name or path.

## Example Log File

When a privileged port binding is detected, a log entry like the following is saved in the log file:

```
Privileged Port Bindings Log - 2024-12-22 22:15:00
============================================================
[2024-12-22 22:15:05] Privileged Port Binding - PID: 1234, Name: apache2, Local Address: 0.0.0.0:80, Remote Address: N/A, Status: LISTEN
[2024-12-22 22:15:10] Privileged Port Binding - PID: 5678, Name: sshd, Local Address: 0.0.0.0:22, Remote Address: N/A, Status: LISTEN
```

## Notes

- **Permission Requirements**:
  - Elevated permissions may be required to access certain network connection details.
- Processes that terminate quickly or do not persistently bind to ports may not appear in the log.

## Limitations

- The script identifies privileged port bindings by monitoring active network connections at a point in time.
- Rapidly opening and closing bindings may not be captured if the polling interval is too long.
