# log_low_cpu_usage_processes.py

A Python script that monitors and logs processes with unusually low CPU usage over time. This tool helps identify stalled or idle processes that may be inefficiently utilizing system resources.

## Features

- **Low CPU Usage Detection**: Tracks processes with CPU usage below a defined threshold.
- **Real-Time Logging**: Logs process details (PID, name, and CPU usage) with timestamps.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on Linux, Windows, and macOS.

## How It Works

1. The script uses the `psutil` library to monitor running processes in real time.
2. It evaluates the CPU usage of each process and identifies those with usage below a predefined threshold.
3. Low CPU usage processes are logged to a file and optionally printed to the console.

## Requirements

- **Python**: Version 3.6 or newer
- **Dependencies**:
  - `psutil` library (install via `pip install psutil`)

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install psutil
   ```

2. Configure the low CPU usage threshold in the script:
   ```python
   LOW_CPU_USAGE_THRESHOLD = 1.0  # Percentage
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python log_low_cpu_usage_processes.py
   ```

4. Check the log file for processes with low CPU usage:
   ```bash
   cat low_cpu_usage_log.txt
   ```

## Configuration

- **Threshold**: Update the `LOW_CPU_USAGE_THRESHOLD` variable to adjust the threshold for low CPU usage (default: 1.0%).
- **Polling Interval**: Adjust the `time.sleep(5)` line to change the monitoring frequency (default: 5 seconds).
- **Log File**: Logs are saved to `low_cpu_usage_log.txt` by default. Update the `log_file` variable in the script to use a different file name or path.

## Example Log File

When a process with low CPU usage is detected, a log entry like the following is saved in the log file:

```
Low CPU Usage Log - 2024-12-22 23:15:00
============================================================
[2024-12-22 23:15:05] Low CPU Usage Detected - PID: 1234, Name: idle_process, CPU Usage: 0.50%
[2024-12-22 23:15:10] Low CPU Usage Detected - PID: 5678, Name: another_idle_process, CPU Usage: 0.75%
```

## Notes

- **Permission Requirements**:
  - Elevated permissions may be required to access certain process information.
- Processes that terminate quickly or fluctuate in CPU usage may not consistently appear in the log.

## Limitations

- The script evaluates CPU usage in real time. Short-lived processes or those with sporadic usage may not be captured effectively.
- Low CPU usage may not always indicate a problem; some processes are designed to run with minimal resource usage.
