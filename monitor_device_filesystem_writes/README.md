# monitor_device_filesystem_writes.py

A Python script designed to monitor processes writing to specific devices or filesystems and log their activities. This tool is helpful for identifying processes that heavily utilize storage resources.

## Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Tracks processes performing write operations on specified devices or filesystems.
- **Customizable Target**: Specify the devices or filesystems to monitor.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on Linux, Windows, and macOS.
- **Detailed Logging**: Logs process details (PID, name, and write bytes) to a timestamped file.

## How It Works

1. The script uses the `psutil` library to monitor process disk I/O statistics.
2. It identifies processes performing write operations and checks if the activity targets the specified devices or filesystems.
3. If a match is found, the process details are logged to a file and printed to the console.

## Requirements

- **Python**: Version 3.6 or newer
- **Dependencies**:
  - `psutil` library (install via `pip install psutil`)

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install psutil
   ```

2. Specify the devices or filesystems to monitor:
   ```python
   MONITORED_FILESYSTEMS = ["/dev/sda1", "C:\\", "/mnt/data"]
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python monitor_device_filesystem_writes.py
   ```

4. To stop monitoring, press `Ctrl+C`. The script will save all logged data to the log file.

## Configuration

- **Target Devices/Filesystems**: Update the `MONITORED_FILESYSTEMS` variable to list the devices or filesystems to monitor.
- **Polling Interval**: Adjust the `time.sleep(5)` line to change the monitoring frequency (default: 5 seconds).
- **Log File**: Logs are saved to `device_filesystem_write_log.txt` by default. Update the `log_file` variable to use a different file name or path.

## Example Log File

When a process writes to a monitored device or filesystem, a log entry like the following is saved in the log file:

```
Device/Filesystem Write Log - 2024-12-22 16:00:00
============================================================
[2024-12-22 16:00:05] Process: PID 1234, Name: chrome, Write Bytes: 1200000
[2024-12-22 16:00:10] Process: PID 5678, Name: python, Write Bytes: 2000000
```

## Notes

- **Permission Requirements**:
  - Elevated permissions may be required to access certain process statistics.
- Processes that terminate or are inaccessible during monitoring are automatically skipped.
- The script includes basic logic for matching filesystems; further customization may be required for specific use cases.
