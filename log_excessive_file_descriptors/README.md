# log_excessive_file_descriptors.py

A Python script that monitors and logs processes with excessive open file descriptors. This tool is useful for identifying resource-intensive processes that may impact system performance or stability.

## Features

- **File Descriptor Monitoring**: Detects processes exceeding a specified threshold for open file descriptors.
- **Real-Time Logging**: Logs process details (PID, name, and number of open file descriptors) with timestamps.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on Linux, Windows, and macOS (platform-dependent file descriptor support).

## How It Works

1. The script uses the `psutil` library to monitor running processes in real-time.
2. Evaluates the number of open file descriptors for each process.
3. Logs details of processes exceeding the defined threshold to a file and optionally prints them to the console.

## Requirements

- **Python**: Version 3.6 or newer
- **Dependencies**:
  - `psutil` library (install via `pip install psutil`)

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install psutil
   ```

2. Configure the file descriptor threshold in the script:
   ```python
   FILE_DESCRIPTOR_THRESHOLD = 100  # Number of open files
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python log_excessive_file_descriptors.py
   ```

4. Check the log file for excessive file descriptor usage:
   ```bash
   cat excessive_file_descriptors_log.txt
   ```

## Configuration

- **Threshold**: Update the `FILE_DESCRIPTOR_THRESHOLD` variable to adjust the threshold for excessive file descriptors (default: 100).
- **Polling Interval**: Adjust the `time.sleep(5)` line to change the monitoring frequency (default: 5 seconds).
- **Log File**: Logs are saved to `excessive_file_descriptors_log.txt` by default. Update the `log_file` variable in the script to use a different file name or path.

## Example Log File

When a process exceeds the file descriptor threshold, a log entry like the following is saved in the log file:

```
Excessive File Descriptors Log - 2024-12-23 01:30:00
============================================================
[2024-12-23 01:30:05] Excessive File Descriptors Detected - PID: 1234, Name: python, Open File Descriptors: 150
[2024-12-23 01:30:10] Excessive File Descriptors Detected - PID: 5678, Name: nginx, Open File Descriptors: 200
```

## Notes

- **Permission Requirements**:
  - Elevated permissions may be required to access certain process details.
- Processes with fluctuating file descriptor counts may temporarily exceed the threshold and appear in the logs.

## Limitations

- The script evaluates file descriptors in real-time. Rapidly opening and closing files may not be consistently captured if the polling interval is too long.
- File descriptor counts are platform-dependent. Ensure compatibility with your system.
