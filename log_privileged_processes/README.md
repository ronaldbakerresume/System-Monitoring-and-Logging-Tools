# log_privileged_processes.py

A Python script that monitors and logs processes running with elevated privileges (root or administrator). This tool is useful for security auditing and tracking privileged system activity.

## Features

- **Privileged Process Monitoring**: Identifies and logs processes running with elevated privileges.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on Linux, Windows, and macOS with platform-specific privilege checks.
- **Detailed Logging**: Logs process details (PID, name, and username) with timestamps.

## How It Works

1. The script uses the `psutil` library to monitor all running processes.
2. It checks each process to determine if it is running with root (Unix-based) or SYSTEM (Windows) privileges.
3. Privileged processes are logged to a file and optionally printed to the console.

## Requirements

- **Python**: Version 3.6 or newer
- **Dependencies**:
  - `psutil` library (install via `pip install psutil`)

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install psutil
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python log_privileged_processes.py
   ```

3. Check the log file for privileged processes:
   ```bash
   cat privileged_processes_log.txt
   ```

## Configuration

- **Log File**: Logs are saved to `privileged_processes_log.txt` by default. Update the `log_file` variable in the script to use a different file name or path.
- **Polling Interval**: Adjust the `time.sleep(5)` line to change the monitoring frequency (default: 5 seconds).

## Example Log File

When a privileged process is detected, a log entry like the following is saved in the log file:

```
Privileged Processes Log - 2024-12-22 22:00:00
============================================================
[2024-12-22 22:00:05] Privileged Process Detected - PID: 1234, Name: systemd, User: root
[2024-12-22 22:00:10] Privileged Process Detected - PID: 5678, Name: winlogon.exe, User: NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
```

## Notes

- **Permission Requirements**:
  - Elevated permissions may be required to access certain process information.
- Processes that terminate quickly may not appear in the log due to the polling interval.

## Limitations

- On Windows, the script checks for the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user to identify privileged processes.
- On Unix-based systems, it checks for the `root` user. Other elevated roles may not be detected.
