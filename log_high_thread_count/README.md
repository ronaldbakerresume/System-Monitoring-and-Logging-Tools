# log_high_thread_count.py

A Python script that monitors and logs processes with high thread counts. This tool helps identify applications that may be overusing threads, potentially leading to performance issues.

## Features

- **High Thread Count Detection**: Identifies processes exceeding a specified thread count threshold.
- **Real-Time Logging**: Logs process details (PID, name, and thread count) with timestamps.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on Linux, Windows, and macOS.

## How It Works

1. The script uses the `psutil` library to monitor running processes in real time.
2. It evaluates the number of threads for each process and flags those exceeding a predefined threshold.
3. Details of flagged processes are logged to a file and optionally printed to the console.

## Requirements

- **Python**: Version 3.6 or newer
- **Dependencies**:
  - `psutil` library (install via `pip install psutil`)

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install psutil
   ```

2. Configure the thread count threshold in the script:
   ```python
   THREAD_COUNT_THRESHOLD = 100  # Number of threads
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python log_high_thread_count.py
   ```

4. Check the log file for processes with high thread counts:
   ```bash
   cat high_thread_count_log.txt
   ```

## Configuration

- **Threshold**: Update the `THREAD_COUNT_THRESHOLD` variable to adjust the threshold for high thread counts (default: 100).
- **Polling Interval**: Adjust the `time.sleep(5)` line to change the monitoring frequency (default: 5 seconds).
- **Log File**: Logs are saved to `high_thread_count_log.txt` by default. Update the `log_file` variable to use a different file name or path.

## Example Log File

When a process with a high thread count is detected, a log entry like the following is saved in the log file:

```
High Thread Count Log - 2024-12-23 00:00:00
============================================================
[2024-12-23 00:00:05] High Thread Count Detected - PID: 1234, Name: chrome, Thread Count: 150
[2024-12-23 00:00:10] High Thread Count Detected - PID: 5678, Name: java, Thread Count: 250
```

## Notes

- **Permission Requirements**:
  - Elevated permissions may be required to access certain process information.
- Processes that terminate quickly or fluctuate in thread count may not consistently appear in the log.

## Limitations

- The script evaluates thread counts at a snapshot in time. Rapidly spawning and terminating threads may not be captured effectively if the polling interval is too long.
- High thread count does not always indicate a problem. Some applications, such as browsers and database servers, are designed to use many threads.
