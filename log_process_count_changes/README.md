# log_process_count_changes.py

A Python script that continuously monitors and logs changes in the total number of running processes. This tool helps track system activity and detect significant increases or decreases in process count.

## Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuously tracks changes in the number of active processes.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on Linux, Windows, and macOS.
- **Detailed Logging**: Logs changes in process count with timestamps and magnitude of change.

## How It Works

1. The script uses the `psutil` library to count the number of active processes at regular intervals.
2. It compares the current process count with the previous count to detect changes.
3. Any change in process count (increase or decrease) is logged to a file and printed to the console.

## Requirements

- **Python**: Version 3.6 or newer
- **Dependencies**:
  - `psutil` library (install via `pip install psutil`)

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install psutil
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python log_process_count_changes.py
   ```

3. Check the log file for changes in process count:
   ```bash
   cat process_count_changes_log.txt
   ```

## Configuration

- **Log File**: Logs are saved to `process_count_changes_log.txt` by default. Update the `log_file` variable in the script to use a different file name or path.
- **Polling Interval**: Adjust the `time.sleep(5)` line to change the monitoring frequency (default: 5 seconds).

## Example Log File

When a change in process count is detected, a log entry like the following is saved in the log file:

```
Process Count Changes Log - 2024-12-22 21:45:00
============================================================
[2024-12-22 21:45:05] Process count increased by 2: New count = 104
[2024-12-22 21:45:10] Process count decreased by 1: New count = 103
```

## Notes

- **Permission Requirements**:
  - Elevated permissions may be required to access certain process information.
- The script tracks changes in process count at a snapshot in time. Rapidly starting and terminating processes within the polling interval may not be logged.
