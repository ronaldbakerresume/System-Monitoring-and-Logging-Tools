# log_hardware_interactions.py

A Python script that monitors and logs processes interacting with hardware devices, including USB and network interfaces. This tool is ideal for tracking hardware-related activities and network connections in real time.

## Features

- **Hardware Interaction Monitoring**: Tracks processes interacting with network interfaces.
- **Real-Time Logging**: Logs details of network connections and associated processes with timestamps.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on Linux, Windows, and macOS.

## How It Works

1. The script uses the `psutil` library to monitor active network connections.
2. For each connection, it retrieves details such as local and remote addresses, connection status, and the associated process.
3. Logs the details to a file and optionally prints them to the console.

## Requirements

- **Python**: Version 3.6 or newer
- **Dependencies**:
  - `psutil` library (install via `pip install psutil`)

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install psutil
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python log_hardware_interactions.py
   ```

3. Check the log file for hardware interaction details:
   ```bash
   cat hardware_interactions_log.txt
   ```

## Configuration

- **Log File**: Logs are saved to `hardware_interactions_log.txt` by default. Update the `log_file` variable to use a different file name or path.

## Example Log File

When a process interacts with a hardware device or network interface, a log entry like the following is saved in the log file:

```
Hardware Interactions Log - 2024-12-23 00:15:00
============================================================
[2024-12-23 00:15:05] Process: PID 1234, Name: chrome, Local Address: 192.168.1.100:5050, Remote Address: 93.184.216.34:443, Status: ESTABLISHED
[2024-12-23 00:15:10] Process: PID 5678, Name: python, Local Address: 127.0.0.1:6060, Remote Address: N/A, Status: LISTEN
```

## Notes

- **Permission Requirements**:
  - Elevated permissions may be required to access certain process and network connection details.
- Processes that terminate quickly or establish ephemeral connections may not appear in the log.

## Limitations

- The script currently focuses on network connections. For broader hardware monitoring (e.g., USB interactions), additional tools or libraries may be required.
- Rapidly changing connections may not be captured effectively if the polling interval is too long.
