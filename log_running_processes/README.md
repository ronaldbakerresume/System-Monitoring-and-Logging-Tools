# log_running_processes.py

A Python script that logs all currently running processes and their metadata (PID, name, and command) to a text file. This tool is useful for auditing, debugging, and monitoring system activity.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Logging**: Captures and logs details of all currently running processes.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on Linux, Windows, and macOS by adapting to platform-specific process listing commands.
- **Simple and Lightweight**: Uses system commands to ensure accuracy and minimal resource overhead.

## How It Works

1. The script uses platform-specific commands to retrieve a list of all running processes:
   - **Windows**: Executes the `tasklist` command.
   - **Linux/macOS**: Executes the `ps -eo pid,comm,args` command.
2. The output is logged to a text file with a timestamped header.

## Requirements

- **Python**: Version 3.6 or newer

## Usage

1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python log_running_processes.py
   ```

2. Check the log file for the captured process metadata:
   ```bash
   cat running_processes_log.txt
   ```

## Configuration

- **Log File**: Logs are saved to `running_processes_log.txt` by default. Update the `log_file` variable in the script to use a different file name or path.

## Example Log File

A sample log file might look like:

```
Process Log - 2024-12-22 21:00:00
==================================================
  PID COMMAND           ARGS
    1 systemd           /sbin/init
  234 bash              bash
  567 python            python my_script.py
  ...
```

## Notes

- **Permission Requirements**:
  - Elevated permissions may be required to access certain process details.
- The script captures a snapshot of processes at the time of execution. To monitor processes over time, consider running it periodically using a task scheduler (e.g., `cron` on Linux or Task Scheduler on Windows).
