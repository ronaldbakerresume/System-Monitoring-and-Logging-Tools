# log_frequent_process_restarts.py

A Python script that detects and logs processes that restart frequently within a specified time window. This tool is useful for identifying unstable or problematic applications that restart repeatedly.

## Features

- **Frequent Restart Detection**: Tracks process restarts and identifies those exceeding a specified threshold within a time window.
- **Real-Time Logging**: Logs process details (PID, name, and restart count) with timestamps.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on Linux, Windows, and macOS.

## How It Works

1. The script uses the `psutil` library to monitor running processes in real-time.
2. Tracks the start times of processes to determine how often they restart within a specified time window.
3. Logs details of processes that exceed the defined restart threshold to a file and optionally prints them to the console.

## Requirements

- **Python**: Version 3.6 or newer
- **Dependencies**:
  - `psutil` library (install via `pip install psutil`)

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install psutil
   ```

2. Configure the restart detection thresholds in the script:
   ```python
   RESTART_THRESHOLD = 3  # Number of restarts within the time window
   TIME_WINDOW = 60  # Time window in seconds
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python log_frequent_process_restarts.py
   ```

4. Check the log file for frequent restarts:
   ```bash
   cat frequent_process_restarts_log.txt
   ```

## Configuration

- **Restart Threshold**: Update the `RESTART_THRESHOLD` variable to adjust the number of allowed restarts within the time window.
- **Time Window**: Update the `TIME_WINDOW` variable to change the time frame for monitoring restarts.
- **Polling Interval**: Adjust the `time.sleep(5)` line to change the monitoring frequency (default: 5 seconds).
- **Log File**: Logs are saved to `frequent_process_restarts_log.txt` by default. Update the `log_file` variable in the script to use a different file name or path.

## Example Log File

When a process restarts frequently, a log entry like the following is saved in the log file:

```
Frequent Process Restarts Log - 2024-12-23 00:45:00
============================================================
[2024-12-23 00:45:05] Frequent Restarts Detected - PID: 1234, Name: my_app, Restarts: 4
[2024-12-23 00:45:10] Frequent Restarts Detected - PID: 5678, Name: unstable_process, Restarts: 5
```

## Notes

- **Permission Requirements**:
  - Elevated permissions may be required to access certain process details.
- Processes that restart very quickly and terminate before being detected may not be logged.

## Limitations

- The script tracks only processes that are visible at the time of polling. It may miss short-lived processes if the polling interval is too long.
- Frequent restarts are evaluated based on process creation timestamps. Processes reusing the same PID may result in incorrect counts.
