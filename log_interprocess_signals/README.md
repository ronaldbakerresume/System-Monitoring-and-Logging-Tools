# log_interprocess_signals.py

A Python script that tracks and logs inter-process communication (IPC) signals, such as `SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`, and optionally `SIGHUP`. This tool is useful for debugging and auditing IPC signals within a system.

## Features

- **Signal Tracking**: Logs key signals, including `SIGINT` (interrupt), `SIGTERM` (terminate), and `SIGHUP` (hang-up).
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Detects and logs signals as they are received by the script.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Supports common signals on Linux, Windows, and macOS.

## How It Works

1. The script uses Python's `signal` module to intercept IPC signals.
2. When a signal is received, the signal number and name are logged to a file with a timestamp.
3. The script runs in an infinite loop to monitor signals continuously.

## Requirements

- **Python**: Version 3.6 or newer

## Usage

1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python log_interprocess_signals.py
   ```

2. To test signal logging:
   - **Send `SIGINT`**: Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.
   - **Send `SIGTERM`**: Use the `kill` command with the process ID:
     ```bash
     kill -15 <pid>
     ```
   - **Send `SIGHUP`** (if supported on your platform):
     ```bash
     kill -1 <pid>
     ```

3. Check the log file for recorded signals:
   ```bash
   cat interprocess_signals_log.txt
   ```

## Configuration

- **Log File**: Logs are saved to `interprocess_signals_log.txt` by default. Update the `log_file` variable to use a different file name or path.
- **Custom Signals**: Add additional signals to monitor by using `signal.signal()` and mapping them to the `signal_handler` function.

## Example Log File

When signals are received, a log entry like the following is saved in the log file:

```
Inter-Process Signal Log - 2024-12-22 23:55:00
============================================================
[2024-12-22 23:55:05] Received Signal: SIGINT (Number: 2)
[2024-12-22 23:55:10] Received Signal: SIGTERM (Number: 15)
[2024-12-22 23:55:15] Received Signal: SIGHUP (Number: 1)
```

## Notes

- **Permission Requirements**:
  - Elevated permissions are not required for this script unless testing with certain restricted signals.
- **Platform-Specific Signals**:
  - Signals like `SIGHUP` may not be available on Windows.
- The script is passive and does not interfere with signal delivery. It only logs received signals.

## Limitations

- The script tracks signals received by the process it runs in. It cannot log signals sent to other processes.
- Running the script in a terminal may limit its testing scope to signals like `SIGINT`. Use `kill` commands for broader testing.
