# log_listening_processes.py

A Python script that logs all processes listening on specific network ports. This tool is useful for auditing network activity and identifying processes bound to critical ports.

## Features

- **Listening Port Monitoring**: Logs processes listening on a predefined list of network ports.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on Linux, Windows, and macOS with platform-specific commands.
- **Detailed Logging**: Captures and logs raw output of the network status for monitored ports.

## How It Works

1. The script uses platform-specific commands to list network connections:
   - **Windows**: Executes the `netstat -ano` command to list all connections with process IDs.
   - **Linux/macOS**: Executes the `netstat -tuln` command to show listening ports.
2. Filters the output for processes listening on specified ports.
3. Logs the matching lines to a file and optionally prints them to the console.

## Requirements

- **Python**: Version 3.6 or newer
- **Dependencies**:
  - None (relies on built-in `subprocess` module).

## Usage

1. Define the ports to monitor in the script:
   ```python
   MONITORED_PORTS = [22, 80, 443, 8080]  # Add ports of interest
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python log_listening_processes.py
   ```

3. Check the log file for processes listening on the specified ports:
   ```bash
   cat listening_processes_log.txt
   ```

## Configuration

- **Monitored Ports**: Update the `MONITORED_PORTS` list to include the ports you wish to monitor.
- **Log File**: Logs are saved to `listening_processes_log.txt` by default. Update the `log_file` variable to use a different file name or path.

## Example Log File

When a process is detected listening on a monitored port, a log entry like the following is saved in the log file:

```
Listening Process Log - 2024-12-22 23:30:00
============================================================
[2024-12-22 23:30:05] tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:22              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN
[2024-12-22 23:30:10] tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:80              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN
```

## Notes

- **Permission Requirements**:
  - Elevated permissions may be required to access certain network information.
- Processes that bind to ports temporarily may not appear in the log if they start and stop within the polling interval.

## Limitations

- The script captures a snapshot of listening processes at the time of execution. For continuous monitoring, consider wrapping it in a loop or using a task scheduler (e.g., `cron` on Linux or Task Scheduler on Windows).
- The output format may vary depending on the operating system and `netstat` version.
