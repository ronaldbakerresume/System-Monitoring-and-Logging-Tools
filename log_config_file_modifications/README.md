# log_config_file_modifications.py

A Python script that detects and logs processes attempting to modify critical system configuration files. This tool is essential for monitoring unauthorized or accidental changes to sensitive system files.

## Features

- **Configuration File Monitoring**: Tracks write access attempts to a predefined list of critical configuration files.
- **Real-Time Logging**: Logs process details (PID, name, and file path) with timestamps.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on Linux, Windows, and macOS.

## How It Works

1. The script uses the `psutil` library to monitor running processes and their open files.
2. Checks if any process has opened critical configuration files in write mode.
3. Logs details of such processes to a file and optionally prints them to the console.

## Requirements

- **Python**: Version 3.6 or newer
- **Dependencies**:
  - `psutil` library (install via `pip install psutil`)

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install psutil
   ```

2. Define the critical configuration files to monitor in the script:
   ```python
   CONFIG_FILES = ["/etc/passwd", "/etc/hosts", "/etc/sudoers", "C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts"]
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python log_config_file_modifications.py
   ```

4. Check the log file for modification attempts:
   ```bash
   cat config_file_modifications_log.txt
   ```

## Configuration

- **Monitored Configuration Files**: Update the `CONFIG_FILES` list to include the paths of configuration files you wish to monitor.
- **Polling Interval**: Adjust the `time.sleep(5)` line to change the monitoring frequency (default: 5 seconds).
- **Log File**: Logs are saved to `config_file_modifications_log.txt` by default. Update the `log_file` variable in the script to use a different file name or path.

## Example Log File

When a modification attempt is detected, a log entry like the following is saved in the log file:

```
Configuration File Modification Log - 2024-12-23 03:15:00
============================================================
[2024-12-23 03:15:05] Configuration File Modification Detected - PID: 1234, Name: python, File: /etc/passwd
[2024-12-23 03:15:10] Configuration File Modification Detected - PID: 5678, Name: vim, File: /etc/hosts
```

## Notes

- **Permission Requirements**:
  - Elevated permissions may be required to access file and process details for certain configuration files.
- **Target Files**:
  - Only the files listed in the `CONFIG_FILES` variable are monitored.

## Limitations

- The script detects write access to files in real-time. Rapid file opening and closure may not be captured if the polling interval is too long.
- Files accessed indirectly (e.g., via symbolic links or network shares) may require additional handling to ensure accurate monitoring.
