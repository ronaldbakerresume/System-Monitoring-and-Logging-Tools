# log_shared_memory_processes.py

A Python script that monitors processes using shared memory and logs their details. This tool is ideal for identifying resource-intensive applications and understanding shared memory usage across processes.

## Features

- **Shared Memory Tracking**: Monitors processes utilizing shared memory resources.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on Linux, Windows, and macOS (where supported by `psutil`).
- **Detailed Logging**: Logs process details (PID, name, and shared memory usage) with timestamps.

## How It Works

1. The script uses the `psutil` library to access information about all running processes.
2. It checks if processes have non-zero shared memory usage.
3. Details of processes with shared memory usage are logged to a file and printed to the console.

## Requirements

- **Python**: Version 3.6 or newer
- **Dependencies**:
  - `psutil` library (install via `pip install psutil`)

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install psutil
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python log_shared_memory_processes.py
   ```

3. Check the log file for processes using shared memory:
   ```bash
   cat shared_memory_processes_log.txt
   ```

## Configuration

- **Log File**: Logs are saved to `shared_memory_processes_log.txt` by default. Update the `log_file` variable to use a different file name or path.

## Example Log File

When a process uses shared memory, a log entry like the following is saved in the log file:

```
Shared Memory Process Log - 2024-12-22 20:45:00
============================================================
[2024-12-22 20:45:05] Process: PID 1234, Name: chrome, Shared Memory: 45.32 MB
[2024-12-22 20:45:10] Process: PID 5678, Name: python, Shared Memory: 30.45 MB
```

## Notes

- **Permission Requirements**:
  - Elevated permissions may be required to access certain process memory information.
- Processes that terminate quickly may not appear in the logs if the shared memory usage fluctuates frequently.
- Shared memory logging depends on platform support within the `psutil` library.
