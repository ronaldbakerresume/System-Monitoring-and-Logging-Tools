# log_kernel_module_access.py

A Python script that monitors and logs processes accessing specific kernel modules or drivers. This tool is designed to detect unauthorized or unusual interactions with kernel-level resources, particularly on Linux systems.

## Features

- **Kernel Module Monitoring**: Tracks processes that open files in specified kernel module or driver paths.
- **Real-Time Logging**: Logs process details (PID, name, and accessed file path) with timestamps.
- **Linux-Specific**: Focuses on Linux-specific kernel module paths (e.g., `/proc/modules`, `/lib/modules`).

## How It Works

1. The script uses the `psutil` library to monitor running processes.
2. For each process, it checks the list of open files to identify accesses to monitored kernel module paths.
3. Any detected access is logged to a file and optionally printed to the console.

## Requirements

- **Python**: Version 3.6 or newer
- **Dependencies**:
  - `psutil` library (install via `pip install psutil`)

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install psutil
   ```

2. Define the list of kernel modules or drivers to monitor in the script:
   ```python
   MONITORED_MODULES = ["/proc/modules", "/lib/modules", "/sys/module"]
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python log_kernel_module_access.py
   ```

4. Check the log file for kernel module access details:
   ```bash
   cat kernel_module_access_log.txt
   ```

## Configuration

- **Monitored Modules**: Update the `MONITORED_MODULES` list to include paths to specific kernel modules or drivers of interest.
- **Log File**: Logs are saved to `kernel_module_access_log.txt` by default. Update the `log_file` variable to use a different file name or path.
- **Polling Interval**: Adjust the `time.sleep(5)` line to change the monitoring frequency (default: 5 seconds).

## Example Log File

When a process accesses a monitored kernel module, a log entry like the following is saved in the log file:

```
Kernel Module Access Log - 2024-12-22 23:45:00
============================================================
[2024-12-22 23:45:05] Process: PID 1234, Name: insmod, Accessed Path: /proc/modules
[2024-12-22 23:45:10] Process: PID 5678, Name: rmmod, Accessed Path: /lib/modules/5.4.0/kernel/drivers/net
```

## Notes

- **Permission Requirements**:
  - Elevated permissions may be required to access certain process information or file descriptors.
- Processes that terminate quickly or access kernel modules for a short duration may not appear in the log.

## Limitations

- The script is focused on Linux-specific kernel module paths. It may not provide meaningful results on Windows or macOS.
- Rapid access and closure of files within monitored paths may not be captured if the polling interval is too long.
