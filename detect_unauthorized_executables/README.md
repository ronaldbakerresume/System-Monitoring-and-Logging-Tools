# detect_unauthorized_executables.py

A Python script that detects and logs processes using unauthorized executables or scripts. This tool is useful for identifying malicious or suspicious activity on a system.

## Features

- **Unauthorized Executable Detection**: Monitors and logs processes that use predefined unauthorized executables or scripts.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Logs process details (PID, name, and command-line arguments) with timestamps.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on Linux, Windows, and macOS.

## How It Works

1. The script uses the `psutil` library to monitor running processes.
2. Checks the command-line arguments of each process against a list of unauthorized executables or script names.
3. Logs details of unauthorized processes to a file and optionally prints them to the console.

## Requirements

- **Python**: Version 3.6 or newer
- **Dependencies**:
  - `psutil` library (install via `pip install psutil`)

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install psutil
   ```

2. Define the list of unauthorized executables or scripts in the script:
   ```python
   UNAUTHORIZED_EXECUTABLES = ["malicious.exe", "unauthorized.py", "hacker_tool", "suspicious_script.sh"]
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python detect_unauthorized_executables.py
   ```

4. Check the log file for unauthorized executable detections:
   ```bash
   cat unauthorized_executables_log.txt
   ```

## Configuration

- **Unauthorized Executables**: Update the `UNAUTHORIZED_EXECUTABLES` list with names of executables or scripts to monitor.
- **Log File**: Logs are saved to `unauthorized_executables_log.txt` by default. Update the `log_file` variable in the script to use a different file name or path.

## Example Log File

When an unauthorized process is detected, a log entry like the following is saved in the log file:

```
Unauthorized Executables Log - 2024-12-23 03:30:00
============================================================
[2024-12-23 03:30:05] Unauthorized Process Detected - PID: 1234, Name: malicious.exe, Command: malicious.exe --target /etc/passwd
[2024-12-23 03:30:10] Unauthorized Process Detected - PID: 5678, Name: unauthorized.py, Command: python unauthorized.py --verbose
```

## Notes

- **Permission Requirements**:
  - Elevated permissions may be required to access details of certain processes.
- Processes that use indirect or obfuscated command-line arguments may require additional monitoring mechanisms for detection.

## Limitations

- The script checks command-line arguments in real-time. Processes that execute and terminate quickly may not be captured.
- Ensure that the names in the `UNAUTHORIZED_EXECUTABLES` list are specific and accurately represent potential threats to minimize false positives.
