# log_temp_file_disk_usage.py

A Python script that monitors and logs disk space usage of processes writing to temporary files. This tool is useful for identifying resource-intensive processes utilizing temporary directories.

## Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuously tracks disk usage by processes writing to temporary files.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on Linux, Windows, and macOS.
- **Detailed Logging**: Logs process details (PID, name, and temporary file disk usage) with timestamps.

## How It Works

1. The script uses the `psutil` library to access information about processes and their open files.
2. It checks the temporary directory (`/tmp` on Linux/macOS or `C:\Windows\Temp` on Windows) for disk usage by each process.
3. Processes with non-zero disk usage in the temporary directory are logged to a file and printed to the console.

## Requirements

- **Python**: Version 3.6 or newer
- **Dependencies**:
  - `psutil` library (install via `pip install psutil`)

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install psutil
   ```

2. Define the temporary directory path in the script:
   ```python
   TEMP_DIR = "/tmp" if os.name != "nt" else "C:\\Windows\\Temp"
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python log_temp_file_disk_usage.py
   ```

4. To stop monitoring, press `Ctrl+C`. The script will save all logged data to the log file.

## Configuration

- **Temporary Directory**: Update the `TEMP_DIR` variable to specify the path of the temporary directory to monitor.
- **Polling Interval**: Adjust the `time.sleep(5)` line to change the monitoring frequency (default: 5 seconds).
- **Log File**: Logs are saved to `temp_file_disk_usage_log.txt` by default. Update the `log_file` variable to use a different file name or path.

## Example Log File

When a process writes to temporary files, a log entry like the following is saved in the log file:

```
Temporary File Disk Usage Log - 2024-12-22 19:30:00
============================================================
[2024-12-22 19:30:05] Process: PID 1234, Name: chrome, Temporary Disk Usage: 15.67 MB
[2024-12-22 19:30:10] Process: PID 5678, Name: python, Temporary Disk Usage: 32.45 MB
```

## Notes

- **Permission Requirements**:
  - Elevated permissions may be required to access certain process information.
- Processes that terminate quickly or are inaccessible during monitoring are automatically skipped.
- Open files that are removed while being accessed may result in skipped entries or errors.
