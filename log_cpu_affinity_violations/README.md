# log_cpu_affinity_violations.py

A Python script that monitors and logs CPU affinity violations of processes. This tool helps ensure processes adhere to their assigned CPU cores, which is critical for performance optimization and workload distribution.

## Features

- **CPU Affinity Monitoring**: Tracks the CPU affinity of processes against expected configurations.
- **Violation Detection**: Logs instances where processes deviate from their assigned CPU cores.
- **Real-Time Logging**: Logs process details (PID, name, and CPU affinity) with timestamps.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on Linux, Windows, and macOS.

## How It Works

1. The script uses the `psutil` library to monitor running processes in real-time.
2. Compares the current CPU affinity of specified processes with their expected CPU cores.
3. Logs violations to a file and optionally prints them to the console.

## Requirements

- **Python**: Version 3.6 or newer
- **Dependencies**:
  - `psutil` library (install via `pip install psutil`)

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install psutil
   ```

2. Define the expected CPU affinity for processes in the script:
   ```python
   EXPECTED_AFFINITY = {
       "example_process_1": [0, 1],  # Process name and its assigned cores
       "example_process_2": [2, 3]
   }
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python log_cpu_affinity_violations.py
   ```

4. Check the log file for CPU affinity violations:
   ```bash
   cat cpu_affinity_violations_log.txt
   ```

## Configuration

- **Expected Affinity**: Update the `EXPECTED_AFFINITY` dictionary with process names and their assigned CPU cores.
- **Log File**: Logs are saved to `cpu_affinity_violations_log.txt` by default. Update the `log_file` variable in the script to use a different file name or path.

## Example Log File

When a CPU affinity violation is detected, entries like the following are saved in the log file:

```
CPU Affinity Violations Log - 2024-12-23 03:00:00
============================================================
[2024-12-23 03:00:05] CPU Affinity Violation - PID: 1234, Name: example_process_1, Expected: [0, 1], Current: [2, 3]
[2024-12-23 03:00:10] CPU Affinity Violation - PID: 5678, Name: example_process_2, Expected: [2, 3], Current: [0, 1]
```

## Notes

- **Permission Requirements**:
  - Elevated permissions may be required to access or modify the CPU affinity of certain processes.
- Only processes explicitly listed in the `EXPECTED_AFFINITY` dictionary are monitored.

## Limitations

- Not all operating systems or processes support CPU affinity. Processes that do not support it will be skipped.
- The script checks CPU affinity in real-time. Temporary changes between polling intervals may not be captured.
