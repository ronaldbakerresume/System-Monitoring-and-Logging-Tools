# log_excessive_child_processes.py

A Python script that monitors and logs processes spawning excessive child processes. This tool is designed to detect potential process spawning loops or abuse, which can lead to system resource exhaustion.

## Features

- **Child Process Monitoring**: Detects processes with a high number of spawned child processes.
- **Real-Time Logging**: Logs process details (PID, name, and number of child processes) with timestamps.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on Linux, Windows, and macOS.

## How It Works

1. The script uses the `psutil` library to monitor running processes in real-time.
2. Evaluates the number of child processes for each parent process.
3. Logs details of processes exceeding the defined threshold to a file and optionally prints them to the console.

## Requirements

- **Python**: Version 3.6 or newer
- **Dependencies**:
  - `psutil` library (install via `pip install psutil`)

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install psutil
   ```

2. Configure the child process threshold in the script:
   ```python
   CHILD_PROCESS_THRESHOLD = 10  # Number of child processes
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python log_excessive_child_processes.py
   ```

4. Check the log file for excessive child process details:
   ```bash
   cat excessive_child_processes_log.txt
   ```

## Configuration

- **Threshold**: Update the `CHILD_PROCESS_THRESHOLD` variable to adjust the threshold for excessive child processes (default: 10).
- **Polling Interval**: Adjust the `time.sleep(5)` line to change the monitoring frequency (default: 5 seconds).
- **Log File**: Logs are saved to `excessive_child_processes_log.txt` by default. Update the `log_file` variable in the script to use a different file name or path.

## Example Log File

When a process exceeds the child process threshold, a log entry like the following is saved in the log file:

```
Excessive Child Processes Log - 2024-12-23 01:45:00
============================================================
[2024-12-23 01:45:05] Excessive Child Processes Detected - PID: 1234, Name: python, Child Process Count: 15
[2024-12-23 01:45:10] Excessive Child Processes Detected - PID: 5678, Name: bash, Child Process Count: 20
```

## Notes

- **Permission Requirements**:
  - Elevated permissions may be required to access certain process details or child processes.
- Processes with fluctuating child process counts may temporarily exceed the threshold and appear in the logs.

## Limitations

- The script evaluates child processes in real-time. Rapidly spawning and terminating child processes may not be consistently captured if the polling interval is too long.
- Recursive child process checking includes all descendant processes, not just direct children.
