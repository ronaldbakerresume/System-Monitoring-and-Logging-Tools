# monitor_command_line_arguments.py

A Python script that monitors command-line arguments of running processes and logs suspicious activity based on predefined patterns. This tool helps detect potential security threats, such as unauthorized actions or malicious processes.

## Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuously inspects the command-line arguments of all running processes.
- **Customizable Patterns**: Specify suspicious keywords to identify potential threats.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on Linux, Windows, and macOS.
- **Detailed Logging**: Logs process details (PID, name, and command-line arguments) for flagged activity.

## How It Works

1. The script uses the `psutil` library to access process information, including command-line arguments.
2. It checks for predefined suspicious keywords in the command-line arguments.
3. If a match is found, the process details are logged to a file and printed to the console.

## Requirements

- **Python**: Version 3.6 or newer
- **Dependencies**:
  - `psutil` library (install via `pip install psutil`)

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install psutil
   ```

2. Define the suspicious keywords in the script:
   ```python
   SUSPICIOUS_KEYWORDS = ["hack", "exploit", "malware", "ransomware", "unauthorized"]
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python monitor_command_line_arguments.py
   ```

4. To stop monitoring, press `Ctrl+C`. The script will save all logged data to the log file.

## Configuration

- **Suspicious Keywords**: Update the `SUSPICIOUS_KEYWORDS` list in the script to include the patterns you want to monitor.
- **Polling Interval**: Adjust the `time.sleep(5)` line to change the monitoring frequency (default: 5 seconds).
- **Log File**: Logs are saved to `suspicious_command_args_log.txt` by default. Update the `log_file` variable to use a different file name or path.

## Example Log File

When a suspicious process is detected, a log entry like the following is saved in the log file:

```
Suspicious Command-Line Arguments Log - 2024-12-22 17:30:00
============================================================
[2024-12-22 17:30:05] Suspicious Process Detected - PID: 1234, Name: python, Command: python hack_tool.py --target 192.168.1.1
[2024-12-22 17:30:10] Suspicious Process Detected - PID: 5678, Name: malware.exe, Command: malware.exe --silent --encrypt
```

## Notes

- **Permission Requirements**:
  - Elevated permissions may be required to access certain process information.
- Processes that terminate quickly or are inaccessible during monitoring are automatically skipped.
- The script runs in a continuous loop for real-time monitoring. To run it periodically, consider using a task scheduler (e.g., `cron` on Linux or Task Scheduler on Windows).
